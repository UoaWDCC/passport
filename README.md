# WDCC Passport
In recent years, WDCC’s marketing team has always been wondering how they can increase the engagement of the events that WDCC runs. Therefore, the marketing team has come up with an idea of a potential passport. The idea is that whenever registered users attend a WDCC event, they would be able to scan a QR code of some sort and this would add to the number of events that they have attended (stamp their passport). Then, the marketing team would be able to hand out prizes or badges  to students who have attended a significant number of events throughout the years. Therefore, the marketing team has asked if an application could be built to support scanning QR codes, events and a reward system in a gamified way. Future plans would be to integrate this passport to the existing WDCC’s club membership checker internal tool.
